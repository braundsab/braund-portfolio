    <div style="line-height: 1.8;">
      <p style="font-size: 1.125rem;">
        My background spans travel marketing, corporate branding, and B2B communications. I've written for companies selling adventure tours and destination management organizations attracting visitors. I've helped rebrand product lines, craft corporate culture books, and build organizational brands from the ground up. At G Adventures, I wrote as a traveler craving off-the-beaten-path experiences. At Epicure, I became a suburban parent seeking social connection and extra income. That imaginative empathy, combined with analytical rigour and storytelling craft, is what drives results.

        I'm equally comfortable writing consumer-facing campaigns and governance-focussed work like annual reports and white papers. My project management experience includes integrated marketing campaigns across digital, print, outdoor radio, and email — plus managing complex editorial projects from concept to delivery.

        I also bring professional camera training to the table. I can frame a shot for visual impact and I'm confident on both sides of the lens, drawing on public speaking skills for on-camera work.

          I build campaigns that work because I start by understanding what motivates people. Whether I'm developing a regional ale trail, positioning a destination for investors, or rallying a salesforce, I don't just create content—I develop the strategy, align the stakeholders, build the partnerships, and execute across every channel needed to get results. My projects span the full arc from concept to market activation.
