Welcome to my portfolio! This is an example blog post to show you how posts work.

## Writing in Markdown

You can write your blog posts in markdown using IA Writer or any text editor. Simply save them with:

- The filename format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-post.md`
- Front matter at the top (the section between the `---` markers)
- Your content below

## Front Matter

Every post needs front matter. Here's what each field means:

- **layout**: Always use `post` for blog posts
- **title**: The title of your post
- **date**: Publication date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- **category**: Optional category (photography, strategy, writing, etc.)
- **description**: Optional meta description for SEO

## Adding Images

You can add images to your posts like this:

```markdown
![Alt text](/assets/images/blog/your-image.jpg)
```

Just place your images in the `/assets/images/blog/` folder.

## Formatting Options

You have all standard markdown formatting available:

**Bold text**, *italic text*, [links](https://example.com), and more.
